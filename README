Packaging for pac4cli

See https://github.com/tkluck/pac4cli

The package works like this on the target machine:
- It copies the source code to /tmp/pac4cli
- Executes make install
- Removes the /tmp/pac4cli
- If it is an upgrade, it restores the service status to what it was previously (enabled/started or not)
